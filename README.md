<h1>LANDSCAPE, EASY TENANT MANAGEMENT</h1>

Landscape is a project designed to help landlords better keep track of their tenant's and partner's information.

Whether it be their contact information, the color of their car, what room they are living in, or even their past bills, this application is designed to help you easily keep track of it all.

Dynamic billing calculations is a feature that will allow you to easily calculate bills for each tenant based on their spending of property facilities (think water and electricity). Or you can just keep it at a flat rate.

This application also allows you to email or print physical bills, keep track of expenses, and file documentation for easy retrieval. The end goal is to automate as much of the landlords job as possible.

Evan started developing this application as he is a landlord living with several other roommates, where they operate on a dynamic billing style. Every month, Evan must manually calculate how much each tenant owes. This application would personally save him hours of time and hassle every month.

This project so far is built using Java and Spring, with MySQL database integration.
